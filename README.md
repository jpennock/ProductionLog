Primalend Production Log
Created by Joe Pennock in December of 2014 to maximize efficiency and keep better data for metrics on employee work for Primalend Capital Partners, LP.
Developed in Visual Studio Express in VB.net using some open source items, such as Open POP and MYSQL Connector for .NET. 
The program keeps track of employee work (the actual work flow and clock times for each employee) and then also allows for some management items.
All data is stored in a local MYSQL database that is hosted on a WAMP server.
